Reads cancerTrainingData.txt to find determine whether aspects of tumors (the numbers separated by commas) make the tumor malignant or benign by finding averages of the values of malignant (marked "M") and benign (marked "B") tumors. The code then runs through a line in cancerTestingData.txt (specified by the first number in each line) and determines whether each attribute is above or below the averages (above = malignant, below = benign). The amount of benign and malignant results are tallied up and the majority determines the status of the tumor.
